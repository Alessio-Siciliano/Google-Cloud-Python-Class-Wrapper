# Google Cloud Python Class Wrapper
A work-in-progress package of several classes written in Python to interact with GCP (BigQuery, DataTransfer, Storage etc...).

# Contribute
Feel free to create issues/pull requests or just a message to improve this library 

# Goal
The goal of this package is to collect all the functions that may be useful in one package only. For example: the original library does not have a function to retrieve all the tables used in a query, then we can add this function here.

# Installation
Just run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Classed to be integrated
- [ ] Bigquery
- [ ] DataTransfer
- [ ] Storage

#TODO
- [ ] Implement test
- [ ] Implement Bigquery class
- [ ] Implement DataTransfer class
- [ ] Add more utils classes
- [ ] Implement the correct folder structure
